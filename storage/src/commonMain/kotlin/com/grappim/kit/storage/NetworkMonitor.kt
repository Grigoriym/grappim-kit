 * Whether the device currently has a network at all.

 * Android implementation talks to `ConnectivityManager`, which a host test has no way to reach.
 * As an interface it can be faked, so everything that *reacts* to connectivity stays testable.
 *
 * This says nothing about whether a specific server is reachable — a self-hosted instance on a
 * LAN the phone has just left is "online" here and still fails the request.
